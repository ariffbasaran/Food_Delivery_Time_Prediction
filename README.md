Food Delivery Time Prediction using Python

# About Dataset

Food delivery is a swift courier service offered by restaurants, stores, or independent food distribution companies to deliver meals or products to customers. Orders are usually placed through restaurant or store websites, mobile applications, or food ordering platforms. The scope of delivery can encompass a variety of items such as appetizers, sides, beverages, desserts, or grocery products, often delivered in boxes or bags. Couriers typically use motorcycles for delivery, but in larger cities where homes and businesses are closer, alternative transportation methods like bicycles or scooters can also be used.

# Project Description
In this project, the durations of food deliveries were predicted using machine learning algorithms in Python.
